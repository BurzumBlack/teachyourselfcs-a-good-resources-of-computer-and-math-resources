# Solutions to Human Resource Machine

These are my solutions to the Human Resource Machine game. All code was obtained using game's in-built export method.

If there is one file per task, that means that it solves both for size and sped. In case of a need for two separate programs, they end in a different prefix (siz.hrm or spd.hrm). I have made up the .hrm extension just to differentiate those files from any others.
