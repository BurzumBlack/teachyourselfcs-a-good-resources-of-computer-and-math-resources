# Solutions to Human Resource Machine

These are my solutions to the Human Resource Machine game. All code was obtained using game's in-built export method.

If there is one file per task, that means that it solves both for size and sped. In case of a need for two separate programs, they end in a different prefix (siz.hrm or spd.hrm). I have made up the .hrm extension just to differentiate those files from any others.

All solutions have been authored by me, and I have found great value in working through them before getting any help. If you're here, reading this readme, it means that you're probably interested in using them - I suggest looking up [this website](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Human_Resource_Machine/) before attempting to just copy things over, as the explanations of the problems there are very good.
