-- jumping over instructions that technically happen at the end of a loop --
-- seems to be a common speed gain pattern - we do not have to perform --
-- a certain kind of operation before we get enough input --
-- thus it is clear that checking for it on the first go --
-- is not a necessary thing to do --
