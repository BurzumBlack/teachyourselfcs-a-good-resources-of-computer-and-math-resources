# Tip 1

`.` repeats the last action
`>G` indents until the end of file

# Tip 2

`A` is just `$a`

# Tip 3

`f+` finds next plus
`s` removes character and places cursor there in insert mode. equivalent to `xi`
`;` moves to the next instance of whatever `f` found last time

# Tip 4

Every vim repeatable action has a reverse button.

# Tip 5

`*` executes a search for the word under cursor. you can navigate then using your usual `n | N`.
